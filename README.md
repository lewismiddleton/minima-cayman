## About
I basically hacked this theme together to get it how I wanted it to look.

I have discovered a few bugs which I will attempt to fix. However my limited knowledge of CSS, SCSS and Jekyll may prevent that.

## Usage
To use this theme, specify the remote theme in your `_config.yml` file as shown below.
```yaml
remote_theme: lewismiddleton/minima-cayman
```


## To-do
 - Social Icons have padding (class svg-icon needs padding removed)
 - Post list has date span offset
